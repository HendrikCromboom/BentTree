# BentTree

### A personal library made to trivialize overused functions and expressions
- Big numbers, random numbers, sequencing
- Resource efficient alternatives for Regular Expressions
- Enumification of common datasets used in daily life(countries, capitals, languages, etc)
---
 ### Status
 - Right now the project is actively being build while I add a pleutera of little snippets of code I have ammassed during my free time
